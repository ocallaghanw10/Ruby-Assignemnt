# of the ball coordinates $x and $y, via $x.floor and $y.floor.

# is going to hit. If it if SC_BLANK, it contains empty space.

# You can use this routine for testing of collisions: running 
# the ball and watching it go through the walls is not fun.
# For testing, add "puts" statements to the 'update' routine above
# such that if the value of testmode is true, it will display
# decisions it is making. For example, to report bouncing from a vertical wall 
# you can write the following line:
# puts "LR" if testmode
# to mean that line "LR" will be displayed if testmode is true.
# In this case, you can try calling tryupdate(0,SCREEN_Y/2,screen)
# to see if it will display the correct response.
#
# What your code should display: 
# "LR" for a ball hitting a vertical wall
# "UD" for a ball hitting a horizontal wall
# "no_wall" for a ball not hitting anything
# "racquet_miss" for a ball missing a racquet
# "racquet_hit" for a ball reflecting from a raquet
# "racquet_hit RND" to indicate that a ball reflected from a peripheral part of the 
# racquet.
